## Johnny Yip

I am Johnny and have previously worked as Software Tester and Business Analyst. I am now aspiring to become a Software Developer. I moved to Hong Kong in 2012 to start my university studies at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. After graduation, I worked in Fujitsu as a Business Analyst and got my first taste in the IT and technology industry. In my second job, I had a more hands on role as a software tester, using technolgies and practices many modern day companies were utilising. After working alongside developers on a daily basis I grew more and more intriuged in the role and it's challenges. I wanted to learn new skills and improve my technical abilities therefore deciding to pursue software developer as a career. Technology is evergrowing and there are always new advancements with the ability to create anything. 
We live in a society surrounded and dependant on technology so it was natural for me to become interested and immersed in it.
