## Johnny Yip

I am a former QA engineer retrained at Makers Academy as a software developer. I am able to bring great attention to detail alongside strong technical and non technical communication skills. I have experience working in a multicultural background as I left for Hong Kong to undertake my university degree and decided to start my career there. I obtained several years of valuable experience before returning home to London in 2020.
I am excited to bring the skills I have gained from a QA role and transition to a software developer. I am looking to secure a position in a company where I can continue to develop myself personally and professionally.
